# Birnam Language Design Goals

## Abstractly
- To build a completely moldable programming environment, where everything is accessible to the programmer - like Piumarta's COLA
- To build up semantics gradually, like iolang
- To be metacircular but comprehensible
- To prefer late-bound behavior (message passing) while also allowing for the creation of binary artifacts
- To be able to load any C shared library, wrap it in an interface layer using a simple message passing model, and thereby absorb its power
- To be able to reconfigure itself into a new language at runtime, piecemeal, over time.
- To be able to hot-reload itself, from the ground up, or piece by piece, yet...
- To be able to produce a standalone, AOT-compiled application for users to use without the extra baggage of the fully malleable 'system'
- To carry within itself the full extent of itself, including source code, bytecode, machine code, and a canonical AST (De bruijn encoding) so that code can be truly universal

## Concretely

- To implement Ian Piumarta's 'id' object model in Zig
- To use this to bootstrap a very fine-grained runtime consisting of a module loader, the object system, a compiler, a base-level smalltalk-like object language, and so on
- To grow that language piecemeal into a fully malleable programming language with distributed capabilities.

## Prior art

The repository at ~/dev/c/birnam contains many prior attempts.
