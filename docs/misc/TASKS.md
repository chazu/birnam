# Birnam work tracker

The repository-local **Beads** tracker (`.beads/`, prefix `birnam`) is the
authoritative active backlog. Run commands from this checkout:

```sh
br where
br ready
br list
br show <id>
br sync --flush-only
```

Commit `.beads/issues.jsonl` with related work; the SQLite database is local.
Before changing issues, `br where` must resolve this repository's `.beads/`,
not the unrelated home-directory Maggie tracker.

## Selected sequence — 2026-09-06

Epic `birnam-epic-as7` owns performance preparation for further self-hosting and
Linux support. The dependency graph and acceptance state live in Beads; the
execution map is [Self-hosting performance work](SELF-HOSTING-PERFORMANCE.md).

1. Close Store/PEG startup and docgen performance acceptance.
2. Implement validated CodeProgram metadata reuse, indexed global imports and
   indexed method dictionaries within the existing contracts.
3. Review [Design 73](../design/73-scalable-ordering-contract.md), the proposed
   sorting/String contract. Implementation remains blocked until acceptance.
4. After explicit decisions, implement the remaining collection, Store,
   allocation and Linux stories in dependency order.

Design tickets remain open until their decision is accepted; writing a proposal
alone does not unblock implementation. Preserve the independent Rust cold
bootstrap and existing benchmark thresholds.

## Cleanup decision

The [previous tracker](../archive/TASKS-2026-09-05.md) is archived intact for
provenance. Its outstanding Zig shim deduplication is obsolete after the Rust
cutover. Old Zig-specific JSON, process, networking, module override, and REPL
packaging follow-ups are removed from the active backlog. Broader YAML,
concurrency, and networking ideas remain unselected, not declared implemented.
Completed historical work belongs in the changelog/design history rather than
the active queue.
