# Continuation-aware Id: design and proof checkpoint

2026-10-24. Proposed direction, with initial and boundary formal models. No runtime
or ABI change is implemented. The current production custom-lookup tail gate remains
red; the broader compiler/Execution migration remains held.

The user rejected the shared-private-implementation packaging proposed by the
[entry experiments](oop-entry-seam-experiments.md), and explicitly allowed
considering a small addition to Id itself. The design priority is malleability,
with a public object contract that does not make Execution depend on private Id
state or require both to use one implementation image.

The proposed addition makes the answer destination of a send explicit as an Oop,
and gives the primitive calling convention a bounded-stack transfer mechanism.
Id performs current lookup and direct entry without interpreting continuation
payloads. Execution owns saved computation representations and their tracing;
the scheduler owns ready/waiting policy. Lookup must itself be able to suspend
and resume without replaying effects or losing the pending send's destination.

This is a semantic proposal, not a chosen C signature. In particular, simply
adding a continuation parameter to the existing synchronous send is insufficient.
The metacircular lookup base case and native callback contracts now have
explicit formal models. Native adapters and transfer encoding still need a
concrete implementation and testing. There is no new implicit application lookup
on the selected Method, no fixed payload-type catalog and no approval to relax
those invariants.

The [formal package](../../formal/continuations/README.md) supplies executable
TLA+ specifications, Lean proofs, required negative variants and one reproducible
checker. Its README states the model bounds, fairness assumptions, exact proof
scope and missing implementation correspondence. The checked frame representation
independence and tail-transfer laws support exploring this boundary; they do not
prove all of Id, the compiler, GC, native code or arbitrary scheduler policy.

The [initial receipt](../measurements/oop-continuation-model-20261024.json) records
1,628,246 distinct states across three passing TLC configurations, 19 checked Lean
theorems, nine required TLA+ counterexamples, four reachable-scenario witnesses,
and four rejected Lean implementation mutations. Concrete `decide` witnesses
also reject those mutations, establishing changed behavior rather than merely
proof-script breakage. Kernel audits admit only standard Lean foundational axioms.

The [boundary extension](../../formal/continuations/BOUNDARIES.md) models recursive
lookup, bootstrap publication, source re-entry during lookup, synchronous and
asynchronous native callbacks, ancestor barriers and completion ownership.

The [full boundary receipt](../measurements/oop-continuation-boundaries-20261024.json)
records all 47 TLA+ checks and 41 Lean theorems passing their expected outcomes.
The seven valid configurations cover 1,647,954 distinct states, including 19,708
in the four new boundary configurations. There are 28 required bad TLA+ variants,
12 reachable-scenario witnesses, and 10 rejected Lean mutations. The new models
preserve the full original request across lookup-source re-entry and retain
native ancestors when an asynchronous inner activation returns.

The base case terminates recursion along the seeded chain to the root while
reading a replaceable lookup binding. It is not a termination guarantee for
arbitrary user-defined lookup or cyclic vtable graphs. Likewise, a completion
ticket's native holder must keep it and its required code alive for as long as
foreign code can still access it, including late or duplicate completion.
Rejecting a used ticket is not proof that an expired native pointer is safe.
Address reuse and actual foreign callback lifetime remain implementation obligations.

The next milestone should connect these models to a small executable
continuation-aware Id, including metacircular lookup that suspends and calls back
into language code. Its traces and lifetime behavior must match the contract
before migrating production Execution or choosing an ABI.
